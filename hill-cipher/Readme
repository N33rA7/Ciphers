Summary: This is a small client-server model implemented using hill cipher, where you can send any 4 charcter over the network via UDP. So the catch here is it will 
be sent encrypted over the network. If an attaccker will try to sniff your communication he/she will get encrypted trafiic and your communication will be safe.

Note: This code is written in python2

Pre-requisite python library:

Numpy
Socket

usage:

1. Donwload the repo, copy server.py and client.py in 2 different machines which are going to behave like client and server during communication.
2. Run the server.py script, Enter the message that you want to send to the client.
3. then run client.py script, you will receive the message that you have sent from the server.
4. You can see the encryption using wireshark or tshark.
